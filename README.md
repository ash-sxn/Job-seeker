# Job-seeker(not a good name, I know, will change it later)

## this is a project that I am creating after getting frustated by how much time it takes to apply for jobs and internship. this will be a AI application/agent that will apply to jobs for me with my biodata instead of me, thus saving me a lot of time and effort 

### Ideas/Features It could have in it are
* It Should be able to apply to all the jobs in my domin(devops) and others, for which it'll need to navigate through different UI's of different website. not sure how it'll work but mabe something like a large action model would work, like I saw in rabbit R1's commmercial, or maybe selenium will be enough.
* It will at the end of the day report to me with mail or some other method, how many jobs it applied for and what it write in them or how many jobs it couldn't apply for any reason, so I have data for everything if it every get me in trouble, and imporve it further.
* I'll customize my resume and cover letter according to the job, it'll not lie to the organizations but it'll customize them a bit to make it more approprite for the job, I've heard on social media it's a good idea to do that, and it increases chances of selection.
* I'll also keep track of the reponces I get from applying to these jobs, like if I get to interview process to some job it'll check what it did good and try to impove the system(this might be too farfetched).
* I'll message the recruiters and HR people from the companies who's job it's applying to and try to connect with them too. I've heard it also increases chances of selection 


### thoughts 
* I searched for some other opensouce project which could do these thing, I did find one but it's just an idea in that repo not functional yet.
* and I also searched for products that do this, and did find a couple of them which active customers and pricing, so maybe it can be a business in future.
* another thing is I heard that linkdin doesn't allow scraping in it's platform and bans whoever does it, so we'll need to get around that problem first. Must be possible since other products are doing it.
* I was thinking which langues I should build this with, of which python is clear winner because of all the AI focus of the project. but maybe GO could also work since I have experience with it.
